# echogrid

signal visualization thing. click around, catch ghost signals, decode stuff. 

basically just a grid where you emit signals and watch them decay. theres also ghost signals floating around that you can capture and decode, its defo not a rickroll

## what it does
- 48x48 grid with neon aesthetic
- click to emit signal bursts
- ghost signals appear randomly and move around
- capture ghosts by clicking near them
- decode captured signals (3 step process leads to you know what)
- story fragments unlock as you capture more ghosts
- pattern challenges if youre into that
- keyboard shortcuts for different colors and patterns

## running it
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

then open localhost:5173 and start clicking

## controls
- click anywhere = emit signal
- 1-6 = change colors (green/red/blue/cyan/magenta/yellow)
- q/w/e/r/t = different burst patterns
- n = toggle noise
- space = capture nearby ghost
- tutorial button shows all this anyway

## features
- ghost signal system (they just float around until you catch them)
- story mode thing (unlock fragments by capturing)
- pattern challenges (match the 5x5 pattern in center)
- decode modal (rickroll reveal)
- animations with irregular timing so it doesnt look too smooth
- inconsistent spacing in code because why not
