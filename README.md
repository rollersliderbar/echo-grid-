# echogridd

**Real-time multiplayer signal experiment.**  
Send echoes into a shared grid. Watch them collide, merge, ripple.

## vibe
Chaotic communal visual signal space. Glitch art meets geometry.  
Signal noise meets collective mind energy.

## stack
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- (socket.io for multiplayer later)

## setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and **click anywhere** to emit signals.

## features (so far)
- ✅ Base grid canvas (32x32 cells)
- ✅ Dark signal aesthetic
- ✅ Debug overlay
- ✅ **Click to emit signal bursts** 🔥
- ✅ **Radial burst pattern with falloff**
- ✅ **Dynamic color based on intensity**
- ✅ **Auto-decay: signals fade out over time** ⏱️
- ✅ **Refactored code into utils modules**

## todo
- [ ] Animated ripple propagation (waves!)
- [ ] Collision detection between signals
- [ ] Random background noise/static
- [ ] Multiplayer sync (socket.io)
- [ ] Audio feedback???
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for burst sizes
- [ ] Different signal types/colors
